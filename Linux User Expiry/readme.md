# Linux User Expiry
A developer john has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for john. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named `john` on the App Server 1. Set expiry date to `2021-04-15` in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.


# Solution

As a root user enter the following commands.  
* 1  useradd john
* 2  chage -l john
* 3  usermod -e 2021-04-15 john 
* 4  chage -l john
